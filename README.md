Iglu is a machine-readable, open-source schema repository for **[JSON Schema] [json-schema]** from the team at **[Snowplow Analytics] [snowplow-website]**. A schema repository (sometimes called a registry) is like npm or Maven or git, but holds data schemas instead of software or code.

Iglu is used extensively in **[Snowplow] [snowplow-repo]**. For a presentation on how we came to build Iglu, see **[this blog post] [snowplow-schema-post]**.

## Iglu technology 101

Iglu consists of two key components:

1. Clients that can resolve schemas from one or more Iglu repositories
2. Servers that can host an Iglu repository over HTTP

We also operate **[Iglu Central] [iglu-central]** (**[repo] [iglu-central-repo]**), which is like RubyGems.org or Maven Central but for storing publically-available JSON Schemas.

At this time, Iglu only supports **[self-describing JSON Schemas] [self-desc-jsons]** that use **[SchemaVer] [schemaver]**.
