# Schema DDL

[ ![Build Status] [travis-image] ] [travis]  [ ![Release] [release-image] ] [releases] [ ![License] [license-image] ] [license]

Schema DDL is a set of Abstract Syntax Trees and generators for producing various DDL and Schema formats.
It's tightly coupled with other tools from **[Snowplow Platform] [snowplow]** like
**[Iglu] [iglu]** and **[Self-describing JSON] [self-describing]**.

Schema DDL itself does not provide any CLI and expose only Scala API.

## Current features

### Flatten Schema

To process JSON Schema in typesafe manner sometimes it's necessary to represent it's nested structure as map of paths to properties.
``schemaddl.generators.SchemaFlattener.flattenJsonSchema`` can be used for that.
It accepts JSON Schema as ``json4s.JValue`` and returns ``schemaddl.FlatSchema``.

### Redshift DDL

Current main feature of Schema DDL is to produce Redshift table DDL (with or without Snowplow-specific data).
``schemaddl.generators.redshift.getTableDdl`` method can be used for that.
It accepts ``schemaddl.FlatSchema`` and produces Redshift DDL file with warnings like product types
(eg. boolean, string) which cannot be correctly translated into DDL without some manual labor.

Also there's ``schemaddl.generators.redshift.Ddl`` module providing AST-like structures for generating DDL in flexible and type-safe manner.

### JSON Paths

Amazon Redhshift uses **[COPY] [redshift-copy]** command to load data into table.
To map data into columns JSONPaths file used. 
It may be generated with ``schemaddl.generators.redshift.JsonPathGenerator.getJsonPathsFile`` method.
Which accepts list of ``schemaddl.generators.redshift.Ddl.Column`` objects (which can be taken from ``Table`` DDL object) and returns JSONPaths file as a string.
It's coupled with ``Table`` object to preserve structure of the table. 
For example, you may want to modify list of your ``Column``s by rearranging it depending on some properties, 
but JSONPaths file always should have the same order of fields and thus we cannot rely on ``FlatSchema`` object.
